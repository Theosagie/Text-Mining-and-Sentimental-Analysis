# Text mining and sentimental analysis on hotel reviews

According to IBM Cloud Education (2020), text mining is the process of converting unstructured text into structured format to enable analysis and identify meaning patterns and gain insights to help organisations make better decisions which can improve business performance. It also argues that because about 80% of data in the world are unstructured forma, text mining is highly important to organisations. Sentimental Analysis on the other hand, uses statistics, natural language processing and machine learning to determine emotional meanings in communications. This technique can be applied in call centres communications, online reviews, messages etc. Maria Korolov (2021). 
The purpose of text mining and sentimental analysis on this data set is to transform the reviews made by tourists on 30 hotels/restaurants from unstructured to structured format and thereafter implement sentimental analysis to identify the hotel or restaurant with the highest percentage of negative reviews. Identifying the hotel or restaurant with the highest percentage of negative reviews can give a direction of the service delivery about such hotel. With this information, management of such hotel can investigate into the root causes of customerâ€™s dissatisfaction and address such concerns to improve business performance.
